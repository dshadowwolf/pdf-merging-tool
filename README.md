#PDF Merging Tool
This tool exists for no other reason than to allow multiple PDF's to be merged into a single file as simply and painlessly as possible. Uses Electron and pdf-lib for most of the work, though file preview is handled through the excellent PDF.js from the fine folks at Mozilla.

#LICENSE
