# TODO
* Look into customizing save-file dialog - likely not possible, but it'd be nice to have it match things

# Progression
* Replace `stack menu` with toolbar-like buttons for merge/load zip/save (getting there)
* Can rework merge process to allow for progress bar (thanks Promises!)  (merge temporarily disabled as UI is worked on)
* Figure out PDF.js so we can view a buffer (if not possible use mkstemp or similar to output to a temp file for preview)
